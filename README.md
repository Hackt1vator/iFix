## If you want a jailbreak, you should read the [guide](https://palera.in).

### You can obtain v2.0.0 beta [here](https://github.com/palera1n/palera1n/releases).
If you need an older v2.0.0 beta, please get it [here](https://github.com/palera1n/palera1n/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.5).

# Warnings
- This palera1n rewrite has noticeably different arguments compared to the shell version of palera1n.
  - Highly recommended that you take a look at how to use palera1n-c [here](https://cdn.nickchan.lol/palera1n/c-rewrite/releases/v2.0.0-beta.6/palera1n.1.html).

- This does **NOT** support tethered creation or booting. You must use the older [shell version of palera1n](https://github.com/palera1n/palera1n/tree/legacy) (clone with `-b legacy`).

- We are **NOT** responsible for any data loss, or the result of a device being bricked. The user of this program accepts responsibility should something happen to their device. While nothing should happen, jailbreaking has risks in itself.
  - If your device is stuck in recovery, please run futurerestore `--exit-recovery`, or use `irecovery -n`.

- palera1n will never work in VirtualBox, VMware or any virtual machine that doesn't support PCI passthrough.

# Requirements
- A checkm8 vulnerable iOS device on iOS 15.x or 16.x (`A8` - `A11`)
	-	If using rootful, you will need **5-10GB of space** for the fakefs. This means 16GB devices cannot use the full fakefs creation. However, you can change the arguments to `-Bf` to create a fakefs with bind mounts, so it uses a smaller size, at the expense having unwritable parts in rarely-written paths, and then boot it
	- On `A11`, **you must disable your passcode while in the jailbroken state** (on iOS 16, you need to **reset your device** before proceeding with palera1n).

- **USB-A** cables are recommended to use, USB-C may have issues with palera1n and getting into DFU mode.<details><summary>Technical explanation</summary>The BootROM will only enter DFU if it detects USB voltage, which boils down to checking whether a certain pin is asserted from the Tristar chip. The Tristar does this based on the cable's accessory ID, and apparently USB-A and USB-C cables have different accessory IDs, and the one of the USB-C cables makes the Tristar not assert the USB voltage pin.</details>

- A Linux or macOS computer
	- AMD CPUs (not AMD Mobile) have an issue [with (likely) their USB controllers] that causes them to have a very low success rate with checkm8. It is not recommended that you use them with palera1n.
		- If your device does not successfully jailbreak, try a computer with an Intel or other CPU
    
- Apple Silicon Macs with USB-C
	- USB-C port on Apple Silicon Macs may require manual unplugging and replugging of the lightning cable after checkm8 exploit.
	- This problem may be solved by connecting via USBHub.

# Need help?

Make sure you provide full details on your device, such as:
- iDevice
- iOS Version
- Passcode enabled?
- Logs, if panicked then send latest `panic-full` log from your iDevice.

Using `-V` and `-v` would help with debugging.
